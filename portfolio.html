<!DOCTYPE html>

In your portfolio.html page, make a <div> inside your <main> under your heading. Give it the class="project" attribute.

In your portfolio.html add an <img> to your <div class="project">. You can use a screenshot of the home page or a filler image to represent a website.
Wrap that image in an anchor tag, <a href="index.html">. This will make the image a link which leads back to your home page.

In your portfolio.html, add a <div> after the <img>. Give it the class="project-details" attribute.
In your portfolio.html, add 2 <p> paragraphs to the <div class="project-details">. Give the first one a class="project-name" attribute and the one under a class="project-description".
Put some text in the two paragraphs. A name for your website and a description.
In your portfolio.html, add an anchor tag beneath the two paragraphs in <div class="project-details">. Link it to your index.html and give it the content "Learn More" or something similar.
