The recommended sections of your digital resume you should have from the previous Lab 18 and Lab 21 are Education, Coursework, Skills, Projects, and Experience. You can have them in whatever order you would like and as many other sections as you want, but we'll be adding content to these sections in particular!

Just like your real resume, you may want to consider putting your best assets up front. If you don't have a lot of experience, put more focus on your skills or projects. Fill out the following requirements with your real information as best as you can!

In your resume.html, add an <a href="resume.pdf" download > beneath the <h1 class="page-title">. Give it the content "Download Resume".
Note: This makes a link which downloads a file you link. If you put your resume in the same directory, it will download when this link is clicked. Change the name of the href as needed.

In your resume.html, add a <div class="entry"> under the <h1 class="section-title"> heading for Education, Experience, and Projects.
In your resume.html, add a <h3 class="entry-title"> heading in each <div class="entry">.
In your resume.html, add a <p class="entry-info"> paragraph in each <div class="entry">
In your resume.html, add a <p class="entry-description"> heading in the <div class="entry"> for Experience and Projects
In your resume.html, add an <ul> under Coursework and Skills. Give it either the class="course-list" or class="skill-list" attribute.
